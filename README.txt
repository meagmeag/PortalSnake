This is an expansion of a project done for CS 315 at Sonoma State University. The original project was a simple snake game. I added the portal feature, which allows you to enter into walls. Whichever color you portal into, you will portal out of.

This program is meant to run on systems that support C's curses library (Unix, Linux).
